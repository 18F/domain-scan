## A domain scanner

Scans domains for data on their HTTPS configuration and assorted other things.

**Most of the work is farmed out to other command line tools.** The point of this project is to **coordinate** those tools and produce **consistent data output**.

Can be used with any domain, or CSV where domains are the first column, such as the [official .gov domain list](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/gov-domains-api-c9856).

### Requirements

The requirements here can be quite diverse, because this tool is just a coordinator for other tools. Communication between tools is handled via CLI and STDOUT.

The overall tool requires **Python 3**. To install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The individual scanners each require their own dependencies. You only need to have the dependencies installed for the scanners you plan to use.

* `inspect` scanner: **Ruby** and **[site-inspector](https://github.com/benbalter/site-inspector)**, version **1.0.2 only**.
* `pshtt` scanner: **Python 2** and **[pshtt](https://github.com/dhs-ncats/pshtt)**, ideally installed with `pyenv` via `pip install pshtt`.
* `tls` scanner: **Go** and **[ssllabs-scan](https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan)**, stable branch.
* `sslyze` scanner: **Python 2** and **[sslyze](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/sslyze)**, ideally installed with `pyenv` via `pip install sslyze`.
* `pageload` scanner: **Node** and **[phantomas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomas)**, installed through npm.

##### Setting tool paths

By default, domain-scan will expect the paths to any executables to be on the system PATH.

If you need to point it to a local directory instead, you'll need to set environment variables to override this.

You can set environment variables in a variety of ways -- this tool's developers use [`autoenv`](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) to manage environment variables with a `.env` file.

However you set them:

* Override the path to the `site-inspector` executable by setting the `SITE_INSPECTOR_PATH` environment variable.

* Override the path to the `ssllabs-scan` executable by setting the `SSLLABS_PATH` environment variable.

* Override the path to the `sslyze.py` executable by setting the `SSLYZE_PATH` environment variable. An env var of `PYENV_VERSION=2.7.11` is passed by default, override version with `SSLYZE_PYENV`.

* Override the path to the `phantomas` executable by setting the `PHANTOMAS_PATH` environment variable.

### Usage

Scan a domain. You must specify at least one "scanner" with `--scan`.

```bash
./scan whitehouse.gov --scan=inspect
```

Scan a list of domains from a CSV. The CSV's header row will be ignored if the first cell starts with "Domain" (case-insensitive).

```bash
./scan domains.csv --scan=inspect
```

Run multiple scanners on each domain:

```bash
./scan whitehouse.gov --scan=inspect,tls
```

##### Parallelization

It's important to understand that **scans run in parallel by default**, and so **the order of result data is unpredictable**.

By default, each scanner will run up to 10 parallel tasks, which you can override with `--workers`.

Some scanners may limit this. For example, the `tls` scanner, which hits the SSL Labs API, maxes out at 5 tasks at once (which cannot be overridden with `--workers`).

To disable this and run sequentially through each domain (1 worker), use `--serial`.

Parallelization will also cause the resulting domains to be written in an unpredictable order. If the row order is important to you, disable parallelization, or use the `--sort` parameter to sort the resulting CSVs once the scans have completed. (**Note:** Using `--sort` will cause the entire dataset to be read into memory.)

##### Options

**Scanners:**

* `inspect` - HTTP/HTTPS/HSTS configuration.
* `pshtt` - HTTP/HTTPS/HSTS configuration with the python-only [`pshtt`](https://github.com/dhs-ncats/pshtt) tool.
* `tls` - TLS configuration, using the [SSL Labs API](https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan/blob/stable/ssllabs-api-docs.md).
* `sslyze` - TLS configuration, using the local [`sslyze`](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/sslyze) command line tool.
* `analytics` - Participation in an analytics program.
* `pageload` - Page load and rendering metrics.
* `a11y` - Accessibility data with the [`pa11y` CLI tool](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y) via AWS Lambda (requires an AWS account and some additional setup, described further down this document).

**General options:**

* `--scan` - **Required.** Comma-separated names of one or more scanners.
* `--sort` - Sort result CSVs by domain name, alphabetically. (**Note:** this causes the entire dataset to be read into memory.)
* `--serial` - Disable parallelization, force each task to be done simultaneously. Helpful for testing and debugging.
* `--debug` - Print out more stuff. Useful with `--serial`.
* `--workers` - Limit parallel threads per-scanner to a number.
* `--output` - Where to output the `cache/` and `results/` directories. Defaults to `./`.
* `--force` - Ignore cached data and force scans to hit the network. For the `tls` scanner, this also tells SSL Labs to ignore its server-side cache.
* `--suffix` - Add a suffix to all input domains. For example, a `--suffix` of `virginia.gov` will add `.virginia.gov` to the end of all input domains.

**Scanner-specific options**

* `--analytics` - For the `analytics` scanner. Point this to either a file **or** a URL that contains a CSV of participating domains.

### Output

All output files are placed into `cache/` and `results/` directories, whose location defaults to the current directory (`./`). Override the output home with `--output`.

* **Cached full scan data** about each domain is saved in the `cache/` directory, named after each scan and each domain, in JSON.

Example: `cache/inspect/whitehouse.gov.json`

* **Formal output data** in CSV form about all domains are saved in the `results/` directory in CSV form, named after each scan.

Example: `results/inspect.csv`

You can override the output directory by specifying `--output`.

It's possible for scans to save multiple CSV rows per-domain. For example, the `tls` scan may have a row with details for each detected TLS "endpoint".

* **Scan metadata** with the start time, end time, and scan command will be placed in the `results/` directory as `meta.json`.

Example: `results/meta.json`

### Using with Docker

If using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), it is as simple as cloning this GitHub repository and running:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then to scan, prefix commands with `docker-compose run`, like:

```bash
docker-compose run scan <domain> --scan=<scanner>
```

## Gathering hostnames

This tool also includes a facility for gathering domain names that end in a given suffix (e.g. `.gov`) from various sources.

By default, only fetches third-level and higher domains (excluding second-level domains).

Usage:

```bash
./gather [source] [options]
```

Where source is one of:

* `censys` - Walks the [Censys.io API](https://censys.io/api), which has hostnames gathered from observed certificates. Censys provides certificates observed from a nightly zmap scan of the IPv4 space, as well as certificates published to public Certificate Transparency logs.
* `url` - Given a path to a CSV, reads it and applies deduping and filtering logic. Its only option is `--url`, which can be a URL (starts with `http:` or `https:`) or a local path.

General options:

* `--suffix`: **Required.** suffix to filter on (e.g. `.gov`)
* `--parents`: A path or URL to a CSV whose first column is second-level domains. Any subdomain not contained within these second-level domains will be excluded.
* `--include-parents`: Include second-level domains. (Defaults to false.)
* `--debug`: display extra output

### `censys`: the Censys.io API

To configure, set two environment variables from [your Censys account page](https://censys.io/account):

* `CENSYS_UID`: Your Censys API ID.
* `CENSYS_API_KEY`: Your Censys secret.

Options:

* `--start`: Page number to start on (defaults to `1`)
* `--end`: Page number to end on (defaults to value of `--start`)
* `--delay`: Sleep between pages, to meet API limits. Defaults to 5s. If you have researcher access, shorten to 2s.

**Example:**

Find `.gov` certificates in the first 2 pages of Censys API results, waiting 5 seconds between pages:

```bash
./gather censys --suffix=.gov --start=1 --end=2 --delay=5
```

### a11y setup

Because scanning 1,000+ domains with `pa11y` takes a prohibitively long time, we're relying on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) to provide parallelization.

This requires:

1) An AWS account with access to Lambda
2) A `pa11y-lambda` function (follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/18F/pa11y-lambda)).

Once those are set up, copy the `.env.example` file, rename it `.env` and fill in the following values:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION_NAME` (`us-east-1` should work fine)
- `AWS_LAMBDA_PA11Y_FUNCTION_NAME` (whatever you ended up naming the Lambda function)

---

A brief note on redirects:

For the accessibility scans we're running at 18F, we're using the `inspect` scanner to follow redirects _before_ the accessibility scan runs.  Pulse.cio.gov is set up to show accessibility scans for live, non-redirecting sites.  For example, if aaa.gov redirects to bbb.gov, we will show results for bbb.gov on the site, but not aaa.gov.  

However, if you want to include results for redirecting site, note the following.  For example, if aaa.gov redirects to bbb.gov, `pa11y` will run against bbb.gov (but the result will be recorded for aaa.gov).

In order to get the benefits of the `inspect` scanner, all `a11y` scans must include it. For example, to scan gsa.gov:

```
./scan gsa.gov --scanner=inspect,a11y
```

Because of `domain-scan`'s caching, all the results of an `inspect` scan will be saved in the `cache/inspect` folder, and probably does not need to be re-run for every single `ally` scan.
